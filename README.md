A user-friendly and accessible web frontend for **Namma Ration**, a platform designed to assist BPL (Below Poverty Line) cardholders in easily accessing information and services related to the public distribution system.

## About The Project

In many regions, accessing information about ration entitlements, distribution schedules, and fair price shop (FPS) locations can be a challenging process for BPL cardholders. This project aims to bridge that information gap with a clean, simple, and mobile-friendly web interface.

**Our Core Goals:**
* **Simplicity:** Provide a straightforward UI that is easy to navigate, even for users with limited digital literacy.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure the website is accessible to people with disabilities by following WCAG guidelines.
* **Information Clarity:** Present crucial information—such as monthly entitlements, stock availability, and transaction history—in a clear and understandable format.
* **Multilingual Support:** Offer content in multiple local languages to cater to a diverse user base.

### Key Features
* **Entitlement Check:** Users can view their monthly food grain entitlements.
* **Fair Price Shop Locator:** An integrated map to find the nearest ration shops.
* **Transaction History:** View past transactions and collected items.
* **Announcements:** A section for important updates from the food and civil supplies department.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
